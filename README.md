# Design Patterns

## Description

This repository is intended to demonstrate various Standard Design Patterns used in Object Oriented Systems.
The Language used for the implementation is **JAVA**.

**Note :** The various design patterns are closely related to each other so, in the implementations you can find one design pattern used inside another.<br/>*Eg :* An Abstract Factory is usually implemented as a Singleton Class. However I have tried not to mix the design patterns wherever possible, but in actual systems one may find all these patterns together in use.
## Structure

The design patterns can be broadly categorized into three categories[Design Patterns by gang of four] :
1. *Creational Patterns*
2. *Structural Patterns*
3. *Behavioral Patterns*

#### Creational Patterns
1. **Abstract Factory :**
  <br/> This pattern is used to instantiate objects of related classes through an interface without giving the details of concrete classes to the client.
